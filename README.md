# Final Project | DA Bootcamp


## Introduction

This repository contains the final project of the Data Analytics bootcamp, at Ironhack Barcelona (March,2021).

## The Project

The project consists in predicting the turnover of a company.
Quit rates as rising, and turnover costs a lot to companies. These expenditures could be reduced if a company knew in advance the odds of each employee to quit. 
By combining this probability with employee performance and potencial, companies could focus on the right people to perform retention initiatives.
The goal was to build a model using the most common variables, the kind of information the majority of companies already have.
The metrics used to evaluate the quality of the predictions was accuracy.

## Data

The data used can be found on Kaggle. It is data from a real company, containing 15.000 observations.


## Workflow

The general workflow can be splitted into 5 main steps:

First step: deciding topic and exploring information
Second step: gathering datasets
Third step: cleaning data (dealing with missing values, checking correlations, outliers...)
Fourth step: performing machine learning strategies and checking for the quality of each model
Fifth step: refining data visualization

## Content
